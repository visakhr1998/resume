Flexible, customizable template for creating a printed pdf resume.

## Get started

Clone to your local computer using

```


Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-resume
npm install

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app running! Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

Tried adding some additional functionalities like Animations, Charts etc. The code gives no error however it doesn't work properly
